# ExcelVBA
Excel VBA Tools to make life a little less painful!

This respository contains Excel VBA macros. In an age where the attention in Data Science is all in R and Python, it's perhaps odd to be writing Excel VBA macros. However, it is almost a truth universally acknowledged that you can never escape Excel - it is indeed the common language between end-consumers of data (stakeholders, audiences) and data analysts / scientists. Inevitably someone will always want to have something delivered in Excel. 

Since we cannot escape Excel (and arguably Excel is pretty great in ways), why not embrace it and make the experience more enjoyable?

## Note

Note: For these VBA macros, the file extension ".vb" is added to enable git to recognise the script type. In practice, treat these as plain text files.
