Excel VBA Tools to make life a little less painful!

This respository contains Excel VBA macros. In an age where the attention in Data Science is all in R and Python, it's perhaps odd to be writing Excel VBA macros. However, it is almost a truth universally acknowledged that you can never escape Excel - it is indeed the common language between end-consumers of data (stakeholders, audiences) and data analysts / scientists. Inevitably someone will always want to have something delivered in Excel. 

Since we cannot escape Excel (and arguably Excel is pretty great in ways), why not embrace it and make the experience more enjoyable?

## How to run macros

 An example of the routine would be: 
1. Run Alt + F11 or whichever way you prefer to start up the code editor and the module in Excel
2. Copy and paste the code in from the macro
3. Run

The exception to the above would be custom _functions_, which would be become available as an Excel function once added to the code editor.
